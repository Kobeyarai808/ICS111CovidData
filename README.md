# ICS111CovidData
This program takes a CSV file of COVID data in the United States as input and parses it to a nice Java Swing GUI

I created a COVID-19 Data Data Parser that parsed information off of a CSV file that had information collected from the United States. Information found on the CSV include: date,state,death,deathConfirmed,deathIncrease,deathProbable,hospitalized,hospitalizedCumulative,hospitalizedCurrently,hospitalizedIncrease,inIcuCumulative,inIcuCurrently,negative,negativeIncrease,negativeTestsAntibody,negativeTestsPeopleAntibody,negativeTestsViral,onVentilatorCumulative,onVentilatorCurrently,positive,positiveCasesViral,positiveIncrease,positiveScore,positiveTestsAntibody,positiveTestsAntigen,positiveTestsPeopleAntibody,positiveTestsPeopleAntigen,positiveTestsViral,recovered,totalTestEncountersViral,totalTestEncountersViralIncrease,totalTestResults,totalTestResultsIncrease,totalTestsAntibody,totalTestsAntigen,totalTestsPeopleAntibody,totalTestsPeopleAntigen,totalTestsPeopleViral,totalTestsPeopleViralIncrease,totalTestsViral,totalTestsViralIncrease
